During training, it utilizes both the final response and feedback chain as the fitting target. This pattern, response with the revision process, shows a promising performance gain. Following SelFee, Reflection-Tuning (Li et al., 2023e, 2024d) also utilizes the reflection process as the learning pattern. Noticing the lack of reasoning imitation of the previous methods, Orca (Mukherjee et al., 2023) first proposes Explanation tuning, which aims to learn the reasoning steps, including explanation traces, step-by-step thought processes, and other complex instructions, from the teacher model, rather than just the vanilla styles. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of distilling with this thinking pattern.\n",
